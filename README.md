GSB [Label]
return X

[Label:0]
Power multiplier: Y^x
base on Y, exponent on X.

[Label:1]
permutation: xPy
Y is the rank (starting value), X is the number of operations.

[Label:2]
radian transformation(degree>radian):
X is degree [DEG], if x is 0, then y is angle [RAD].
PI=355/113=3.14159292

[Label:3]
Cosine: y is the angle [DEG], X is the number of operations in the Taylor expansion

sinx=Â±( (1-(cosx)^2)[root] )
tanx=sinx/cosx
